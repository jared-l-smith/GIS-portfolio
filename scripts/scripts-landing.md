 # ArcPy Scripts

 **NOTE: Run all this text through Grammerly before you publish. There's no spellcheck here.**

This is the landing page for all of your ArcPy Scripts. As of nows, Data Science projects/code are in the Projects section. 
We can change this later if we feel different. 

Right now, let's just use code from the Python Final. Let's only include the useful ArcPy scripts. No more than five. 

You need to include your own language introducing your this page. Describe what type of scripts are featured, and why they are important to potential employers.
