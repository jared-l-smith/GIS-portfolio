 **NOTE: Run all this text through Grammerly before you publish. There's no spellcheck here.**

This is the landing page for all of your projects. As of nows, projects include Maps and Spatial Anyalysis, StoryMaps, Data Science, and Stats Analysis.
ArcPy Scripts will contained on thier own page, but our data science code/results will contained here. We can change this later if we feel different. 

Projects will be organized by Skill (Data Science, Spatial Analysis, etc). Within each section, let's organize projects in reverse chhronological order (Newest projects first.) 
Your homepage will have a section for Featured Projects, the ones you are most proud of. 


You need to include your own language introducing your project. Describe what type of projects are featured, and why they are important to potential employers. Example language is below: 

[Technical and scientific writing is a critical skill in GIS and remote sensing. Below are examples of my written work demonstrating my ability to communicate complex spatial analysis and research.]
